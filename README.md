# Real-Time Face Detection Project

Hi! This is my simple face detection project built using Python and OpenCV. The program detects faces through a webcam using a Haar Cascade classifier.

## 🔧 How It Works
- Opens your webcam
- Scans for faces in real-time
- Highlights faces with a rectangle
- Optionally saves screenshots

## 📁 Files in This Repo
- `new.py` – The main Python code
- `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml` – The face detection model
- `face_detection_result.png` – Example of how the output looks

## 🛠 Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (install with `pip install opencv-python`)
- A webcam (built-in or external)

## ▶️ How to Run It
```bash
python new.py
